#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

= Introduction =

I am a gadget geek.  I have all kinds of different gadgets, but a couple of my favorite ones lately have been the PSP and the iPhone.  I've really enjoyed messing around with these.

I am also into videos, all types of videos.  These videos include DVD movies, movies in xvid/dvix format, tv shows and all other things that I can watch on my computer.

And one more thing I really enjoy is Linux.  I really like try to harness the power of the command line in Linux and take full advantage of it.

So, I guess as a natural progression, I have decided to try to combine these three things into my first Google Code project.  What I have done is tried to create some scripts that use the power of Linux, ffmpeg, AtomicParsley, and combine them to make some command line scripts that convert videos, (anything that ffmpeg recognizes) and converts it into video I can watch on both my PSP and iPhone.  These scripts aren't that complicated, but I do find them very useful.

I know there are many programs out there that will convert videos to the iPhone and PSP, but I couldn't find one that was simple and would do it from the command line.  I tend to keeps all of my storage on a Linux machine with all sorts of storage.  Since the videos are there, I like to convert them there as well.  I find that with some simple scripts, I can automate the conversion of these videos in a very convenient manner.  I have some friends who find them useful as well, so I decided to put them here for anyone that would like to use them.
