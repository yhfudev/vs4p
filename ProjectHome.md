# VS4P #
**vs4p** (Video Scripts for Portables) is a set of bash scripts that encode video for portable devices. Supported portable devices are the Apple iPhone and the Sony PSP.

  * The scripts use a combination of FFmpeg and AtomicParsley. FFmpeg is used to re-encode the video into MPEG 4 h.264 format. AtomicParsley is used to set the metadata for the iPhone.

  * In theory these scripts should also be able to be used with all Apple video products (video iPod, Apple TV, etc). However, only the iPhone has been tested.

  * All formats that are supported by FFmpeg can be used as source material. This includes XVid, Divx and MPEG 2.
